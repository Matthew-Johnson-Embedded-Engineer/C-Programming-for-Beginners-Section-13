Section 13: Structures and Pointers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Structures and Pointers

	- C allows for pointers to structures

	- pointers to structures are easier to manipulate than
	  structures themselves

	- in some older implementations, a structure cannot be
	  passed as an argument to a function, but a pointer to
	  a structure can

	- even if you can pass a structure as an argument, 
	  passing a pointer is more efficient

	- many data representations use structures containing
	  pointers to other structures


Declaring a struct as a pointer

	- you can define a variable to be a pointer to a struct

	  struct date *date_ptr = NULL;

	- the variable date_ptr can be assigned just like other
	  pointers

		+ you can set it to point to todays_date with
		  the assignment statement

	  date_ptr = &todays_date;

	- you can then indirectly access any of the members of
	  the date structure pointed to by date_ptr

	  (*date_ptr).day = 21;

	- the above has the effect of setting the day of the 
	  date structure pointed to by date_ptr to 21

		+ parentheses are required because the 
		  structure member operator "." has higher
		  precedence than the indirection operator 
		  "*"


Using structs as pointers

	- to test the value of month stored in the date
	  structure pointed to by date_ptr

	  if ((*date_ptr).month == 12)

	- pointers to structures are so often used in C
	  that a special operator exists

		+ the structure pointer operator "->",
		  which is the dash followed by the 
	 	  greater than sign permits (*x).y to
		  be more clearly expressed as x -> y

	- the previous statement can be conveniently
	  written as

	  if (date_ptr -> month == 12)


Example

struct date {

	int month;
	int day;
	int year;
};

struct date today, *date_ptr;

date_ptr = &today;

date_ptr -> month = 9;
date_ptr -> day = 25;
date_ptr -> year = 2015;

printf("Today's date is %i/%i/%.2i.\n", 
	date_ptr -> month, date_ptr -> day, date_ptr -> year);
